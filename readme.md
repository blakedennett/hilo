Title of Project: Hilo


Description:
Hilo is a game involving card numbers, a score, and continuous guessing of the next card.


Project Structure:
This project is structured into three files. One is a class named score. This class can 
hold the player's score, subract and add to the score, determine the end of the game, and 
display the score. The next class is deck. Deck creates a list of 1000 numbers that are 
random between 1 and 13. Deck also will draw a card which takes from the last item, then 
removes it. Lastly, deck draws the next card but does not remove the last item from the 
list in order to keep the card for the next time around the loop. The last file is program. 
This file contains a while loop that does most of the display to the user and uses logic 
from the two classes to structure the game.


Required Software:
There are a few items that are neccesary in order for this game to work. One requirement
is for the game to be able to loop as many times through the game until the player no 
longer wants to play, or the score goes at or below zero. Another requirement is the game
needs to simulate cards 1-13 allowing the player to guess the quantity of the following
card. Lastly, the software needs to be able to consistently display the game to the user
in a simple and accurate way.
